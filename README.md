# DvdData
These PostgreSQL commands will create a customer ranking system that allows a business to implement a customer loyalty program. The code includes a function that will cast the count into a rank. The user can use the summary view to see how many customers are in each rank. This gives the user quick feedback on how well the customer loyalty program is working.
